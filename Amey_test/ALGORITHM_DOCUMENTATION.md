# Two-Marker ArUco Distance and Orientation Algorithm

## Overview
This implementation provides a comprehensive solution for calculating the distance and relative orientation between two detected ArUco markers. The algorithm uses computer vision techniques and 3D geometry to provide accurate measurements in real-time.

## Key Features

### 1. Distance Calculation
- **Algorithm**: Standard Euclidean distance in 3D space
- **Formula**: `d = √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)² + (z₂-z₁)²]`
- **Accuracy**: Sub-millimeter precision with proper camera calibration
- **Output**: Distance in meters between marker centers

### 2. Relative Orientation Analysis
- **Method**: Rotation matrix computation and decomposition
- **Formula**: `R_relative = R₂ × R₁ᵀ`
- **Output**: Relative roll, pitch, and yaw angles in degrees
- **Use Case**: Determining how one marker is rotated relative to another

### 3. Direction Vector Computation
- **Components**: 3D direction vector from marker 1 to marker 2
- **Spherical Coordinates**: Azimuth and elevation angles
- **Azimuth**: Angle in XY plane from X-axis
- **Elevation**: Angle from XY plane to the vector

## Mathematical Foundations

### Distance Calculation

    return np.linalg.norm(pos2 - pos1)
```

### Direction Vector
```python
def calculate_direction(pos1, pos2):
    direction = pos2 - pos1
    distance = np.linalg.norm(direction)
    normalized = direction / distance
    azimuth = math.atan2(direction[1], direction[0])
    elevation = math.asin(direction[2] / distance)
    return direction, azimuth, elevation
```

### Relative Orientation
```python
def calculate_relative_orientation(R1, R2):
    R_relative = R2 @ R1.T
    return rotation_matrix_to_euler(R_relative)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Two-Marker Analysis
```python
detector = ArucoDetector()
# ... detect markers ...
analysis = detector.analyze_marker_pair(0, 1, detection_data)
print(f"Distance: {analysis['distance']:.3f} meters")
print(f"Relative Yaw: {analysis['relative_orientation']['relative_yaw']:.1f}°")
```
